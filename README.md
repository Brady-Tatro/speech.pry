# Speech.pry

Speech.pry assists those who want better feedback on their speeches.
Using React, React Router and React Media Player users can take speeches uploaded to youtube and bring them into the app where other members can rate them.
Currently the only feedback options are upvote and downvote, with the future feature of full comments to be added.
